This repository contains the homeworks for the course "Big Data Computing" @ Sapienza's M.Sc. in Data Science. 
The homeworks were both theoretical proofs and hands on code on the following topics:
+ *Concentration of measures* for hypotesis design and testing, in particular on random graphs;
+ Generalized MinHashing frameworks for *k-Nearest Neighbour in high dimension regimes*;
+ *Dimensionality reduction* for low-rank approximation and reconstruction;
+ *Random projections* for low-dimensional embeddings.
